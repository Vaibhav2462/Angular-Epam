You probably know, that in Javascript (and also Ruby) there is no concept of interfaces. 
There is only a concept of inheritance, but you can't assume that a certain method or property exists, 
just because it exists in the parent prototype / class. 
We want to find out, whether a given object fulfils the requirements to implement the "SantaClausable" interface.
 We need to implement a method which checks for this interface.



Solution:-
function isSantaClausable(obj) {
  // TODO
  return ['sayHoHoHo', 'distributeGifts', 'goDownTheChimney'].every(function(methodName) { return typeof obj[methodName] == 'function'; });
}
